# Retail_Project
Demonstrated a strong understanding of data engineering concepts, PySpark for distributed data processing, and hands-on experience with real-world data cleaning and manipulation tasks.



Technologies Used:
Pandas (for checking the file existance and read it)
PySpark (for distributed data processing and handling large datasets)
Spark SQL (for querying and manipulating data)
Jupyter Notebooks (for interactive development)
Input data format: CSV
Output data format: CSV/Parquet

Project Explanation: Retail Customer Data Processing
-----------------------------------------------------
Step 1. Data Loading and Exploration:
-------
Loading data using Pandas: I started by loading a retail dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. After loading, I configured display settings in Pandas to show all columns, making it easier to explore the dataset.

Display Settings: I customized display options (e.g., max_columns and width) for better visualization.
Initial Data Exploration: I used methods like .head() and .dtypes to inspect the first few rows and the data types of the columns in the dataset.



Step 2. Converting Pandas DataFrame to Spark DataFrame:
--------
I demonstrated the process of converting a Pandas DataFrame to a Spark DataFrame. This is crucial for working with large datasets that Pandas alone might not be able to handle efficiently.

Conversion: spark.createDataFrame(pandas_df) was used to convert the Pandas DataFrame to a Spark DataFrame.
Schema Issues: I also handled issues related to type inference during conversion, especially when dealing with columns containing mixed data types (like Boolean and Numeric), ensuring consistent data types for efficient processing.



Step 3. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
---------
I performed essential data cleaning steps, including:
Handling Missing Values: For columns with null values, I replaced them with appropriate default values using fillna(). For example:
Numeric columns: Filled null values with 0 for consistency in further processing.

Categorical columns: Replaced null values in string columns with "Unknown".

Casting Columns: I ensured that columns with mixed types (e.g., Boolean and numeric values) were cast into a single consistent data type.
Data Type Conversion: Columns like Price Per Unit, Quantity, and Total Spent were explicitly cast to float and int as appropriate.



Step 4. Filtering Data:
-------
To focus on meaningful data, I filtered out customers who hadn't purchased any products (i.e., where no_of_product_purchased = 0 or null).
This was done using PySpark's filter() method, which is part of Spark's DataFrame API.
I used conditional filtering to ensure the data was meaningful for further analysis and processing.



Step 5. Saving Data:
---------
After processing the data, I saved the Spark DataFrame to disk in various formats like CSV, Parquet.

I used PySpark's write() API to save the cleaned and filtered data into files.

Ensured the data was saved with the header included in the output, using .option("header", "true").

Additionally, I implemented error handling with try-except blocks to catch and handle issues such as missing directories or permissions while saving files.



Step 6. Error Handling:
----------
I implemented error handling to ensure that the data was saved successfully, and if there were any issues (like missing directories), meaningful error messages were displayed.

File Existence Check: I checked if the directory exists before attempting to save the file, preventing errors when writing files.
Exception Handling: Used try-except to handle cases like FileNotFoundError and other potential exceptions during the saving process.



Step 7. Final Output:
---------
After filtering and saving the data, I successfully produced a clean and filtered dataset ready for further analysis or reporting.

I verified the output by checking the contents of the saved file, ensuring the data was written correctly.


Challenges Faced and Resolutions:
=================================
Mixed Data Types: Some columns had mixed data types (e.g., Booleans and numeric values), causing type inference issues during the conversion of the Pandas DataFrame to a Spark DataFrame. I resolved this by casting columns to appropriate types and handling missing values explicitly.

Null Values: The dataset had missing values that needed to be handled carefully. I used Pandas' fillna() method for imputation, ensuring data consistency before further analysis.

Large Dataset Handling: Initially, Pandas was used for loading the data, but as the dataset grew, I leveraged Spark DataFrame for distributed processing to handle larger datasets efficiently.



Key Learnings:
--------------
PySpark DataFrame API: I gained hands-on experience working with the Spark DataFrame API, including filtering, transforming, and saving large datasets.

Data Cleaning Techniques: I practiced real-world data cleaning tasks such as handling missing data, type casting, and dealing with conflicting data types.

Efficient Data Processing: By using PySpark, I was able to process large datasets in a distributed manner, which would not have been feasible with Pandas alone for large-scale datasets.

Error Handling in Data Pipelines: I implemented error handling mechanisms that can be used to build more robust and production-ready data processing pipelines.



Skills Demonstrated:
--------------------
Data Wrangling: Cleaning, transforming, and filtering data to ensure it is ready for analysis.

PySpark: Using PySpark for distributed data processing and handling large datasets.

DataFrame Operations: Applying filtering, casting, and data imputation techniques in both Pandas and PySpark.

Error Handling: Managing exceptions when reading, processing, and saving data, ensuring smooth execution.

Data Export: Saving processed data into various file formats (CSV, Parquet, JSON).
